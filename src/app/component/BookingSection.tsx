              <li>
                Navigating Patient Consultations During a Pandemic: London
                General Practice faced the challenge of efficiently conducting
                patient consultations with General Practitioners (GPs) amidst
                the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. The need to adapt to remote
                consultations while maintaining the quality of care posed a
                significant hurdle.
              </li>
              <li>
                Emergency GP Consultations: Urgent and emergency situations
                require immediate access to GP consultations. London General
                Practice encountered difficulties in ensuring timely
                consultations for patients in dire need of medical attention.
              </li>
              <li>
                Geographical Accessibility: Patients seeking London General
                Practice’s services sometimes encountered geographical
                constraints, making it challenging for them to access the
                clinic’s facilities conveniently. This issue raised concerns
                about equitable access to healthcare.
              </li>
              <li>
                Time-Consuming Travel and Waiting: Patients often spent a
                substantial amount of time commuting to the clinic and waiting
                for their GP appointments. This inefficient process not only
                inconvenienced patients but also had the potential to disrupt
                their daily routines.

                dates, ensuring that they never miss an important consultation.
